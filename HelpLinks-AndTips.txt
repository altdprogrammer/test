# Tips

# Regarding setSate
setState is asynchronous. So if we print it right after setting it will not display the updated value
i.e

this.setState({ searchField: e.target.value }
console.log(searchField);

The above will not display the most uptodate value

In order to get that we need to rewrite the code as follows

this.setState({ searchField: e.target.value, () => {
              console.log(this.state.searchField);
            }}

The above code will show the update value because the console.log will be executed only after setting the State
